# Troubleshooting
Common Issues
‚ùå "Invalid Dataset Structure"
Problem: Dataset missing required columns Solution:

Check task type requirements
Ensure exact column name matches
Verify column names are spelled correctly
‚ùå "File Upload Failed"
Problem: File won't upload Solution:

Check file size (max 10MB)
Verify file format (CSV, JSON, YAML only)
Ensure file isn't corrupted
‚ùå "Preview Shows Wrong Data"
Problem: Data appears incorrect in preview Solution:

Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
Verify delimiter for CSV files
Ensure JSON/YAML syntax is valid
